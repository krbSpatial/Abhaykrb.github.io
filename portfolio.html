            did survey of that area with major point data collection, a bit of digitization and prepared a map for them. The map is suppose to help
          them for proper planning, visualization and better decision making.</p>

                        <p>This was a research project that I did for Indian researchers that were on research related to water quality of wells in Andhra Pradesh region. It was a hectic project where extensive data
                          cleaning was needed to convert excel sheet data to working shapefile data format. I used interpolation technique to generate rainfall distribution maps for years 2020, 2021 & 2022.
                          I also had to prepare chlorine, potassium, Co3AsCaCO3 distribution for pre and post monsoon for all those respective years. Since the workflow was quite repeatative I had prepared a model using QGIS model builder that eased my job.

                    <p>I had helped Mr. Surojit Dutta, Lecturer, Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore in QGIS. I assisted him in preparing training materials
                        for his course Data Analytics in Environmental Sustainability. It particularly helped him in spatial analysis, time series analysis and cartography. These days he is doing great work in QGIS and sometimes he sends me his gis products that makes me really happy.</p>
